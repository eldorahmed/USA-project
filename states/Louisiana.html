    <h3>About Louisiana</h3>
    <p>
      Louisiana[pronunciation 1] (French: Louisiane [lwizjan] ⓘ; Spanish:
      Luisiana [lwiˈsjana]; Louisiana Creole: Lwizyàn)[b] is a state in the Deep
      South and South Central regions of the United States. It borders Texas to
      the west, Arkansas to the north, and Mississippi to the east. Of the 50
      U.S. states, it ranks 20th in land area and the 25th in population, with
      roughly 4.6 million residents. Reflecting its French heritage, Louisiana
      is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which
      are equivalent to counties, making it one of only two U.S. states not
      subdivided into counties (the other being Alaska and its boroughs). Baton
      Rouge is the state's capital, and New Orleans, a French Louisiana region,
      is its largest city with a population of about 383,000 people.[9]
      Louisiana has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the south; a large
      part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River.
