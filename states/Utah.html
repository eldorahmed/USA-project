    <h3>About Utah</h3>
    <p>
      Utah (/ˈjuːtɑː/ YOO-tah, /ˈjuːtɔː/ ⓘ YOO-taw) is a landlocked state in the
      Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It borders Colorado
      to its east, Wyoming to its northeast, Idaho to its north, Arizona to its
      south, and Nevada to its west. Utah also touches a corner of New Mexico in
      the southeast. Of the fifty U.S. states, Utah is the 13th-largest by area;
      with a population over three million, it is the 30th-most-populous and
      11th-least-densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in
      two areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which
      is home to roughly two-thirds of the population and includes the capital
      city, Salt Lake City; and Washington County in the southwest, with more
      than 180,000 residents.[9] Most of the western half of Utah lies in the
      Great Basin. Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various
      indigenous groups such as the ancient Puebloans, Navajo, and Ute. The
      Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the mid-16th century, though
      the region's difficult geography and harsh climate made it a peripheral
      part of New Spain and later Mexico. Even while it was Mexican territory,
      many of Utah's earliest settlers were American, particularly Mormons
      fleeing marginalization and persecution from the United States via the
      Mormon Trail. Following the Mexican–American War in 1848, the region was
      annexed by the U.S., becoming part of the Utah Territory, which included
      what is now Colorado and Nevada. Disputes between the dominant Mormon
      community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state;
      only after the outlawing of polygamy was it admitted in 1896 as the 45th.
