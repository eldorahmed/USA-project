    <h3>About Mississippi</h3>
    <p>
      Mississippi (/ˌmɪsɪˈsɪpi/ ⓘ) is a state in the Southeastern region of the
      United States. It borders Tennessee to the north, Alabama to the east, the
      Gulf of Mexico to the south, Louisiana to the southwest, and Arkansas to
      the northwest. Mississippi's western boundary is largely defined by the
      Mississippi River, or its historical course.[6] Mississippi is the 32nd
      largest by area and 35th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states and has the
      lowest per-capita income in the United States. Jackson is both the state's
      capital and largest city. Greater Jackson is the state's most populous
      metropolitan area, with a population of 591,978 in 2020.[7] On December
      10, 1817, Mississippi became the 20th state admitted to the Union. By
      1860, Mississippi was the nation's top cotton-producing state and slaves
      accounted for 55% of the state population.[8] Mississippi declared its
      secession from the Union on January 9, 1861, and was one of the seven
      original Confederate States, which constituted the largest slaveholding
      states in the nation. Following the Civil War, it was restored to the
      Union on February 23, 1870.[9] From the end of the Civil War to the 1960s,
      Mississippi was dominated by socially conservative and segregationist
      Democrats dedicated to upholding white supremacy. Mississippi became the
      site of many prominent events during the civil rights movement, including
      the Ole Miss riot of 1962, the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, and the
      1964 Freedom Summer murders.
