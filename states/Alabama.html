    <h3>About Alabama</h3>
    <p>
      Alabama (/ˌæləˈbæmə/) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United
      States. It borders Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida
      and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama
      is the 30th largest by area[9] and the 24th-most populous of the 50 U.S.
      states.[10] <br /><br />
      Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama
      is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton State". The state
      tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama's
      capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is
      Huntsville.[11] Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists
      (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.[12][13]
      Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest metropolitan area and its economic
      center.[14]
