    <h3>About Kentucky</h3>
    <p>
      Kentucky (US: /kənˈtʌki/ ⓘ kən-TUK-ee, UK: /kɛn-/ ken-),[5] officially the
      Commonwealth of Kentucky,[c] is a landlocked state in the Southeastern
      region of the United States. Kentucky borders Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio
      to the north, West Virginia to the northeast, Virginia to the east,
      Tennessee to the south, and Missouri to the west. Its northern border is
      defined by the Ohio River. Its capital is Frankfort and its largest city
      is Louisville. As of 2020, the population was approximately 4.5
      million.[2] Kentucky was admitted into the Union as the 15th state on June
      1, 1792, splitting from Virginia in the process.[6] It is known as the
      "Bluegrass State", a nickname based on Kentucky bluegrass, a species of
      green grass introduced by European settlers for the purpose of grazing in
      pastures, which has supported the thoroughbred horse industry in the
      center of the state.[7]
