    <h3>About Vermont</h3>
    <p>
      Vermont (/vərˈmɒnt/ ⓘ)[6] is a landlocked state in the New England region
      of the Northeastern United States. It borders Massachusetts to the south,
      New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province
      of Quebec to the north. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the state had a
      population of 643,503,[7] ranking it the second least populated U.S. state
      ahead of Wyoming. It is the nation's sixth smallest state in area. The
      state's capital of Montpelier is the least populous U.S. state capital. No
      other U.S. state has a most populous city with fewer residents than
      Burlington. Vermont is also well known for being the largest producer of
      true maple syrup in the United States for over 200 years. Native Americans
      have inhabited the area for about 12,000 years. The competitive tribes of
      the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were active
      in the area at the time of European encounter. During the 17th century,
      French colonists claimed the territory as part of the Kingdom of France's
      colony of New France. After the Kingdom of Great Britain began to settle
      colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed
      in North America in addition to Europe. After being defeated in 1763 in
      the Seven Years' War, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi
      River to Great Britain.
