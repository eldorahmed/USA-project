    <h3>About Oregon</h3>
    <p>
      Oregon (/ˈɒrɪɡən/ ⓘ)[7] is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the
      United States. Oregon is a part of the Western United States, with the
      Columbia River delineating much of Oregon's northern boundary with
      Washington, while the Snake River delineates much of its eastern boundary
      with Idaho. The 42° north parallel delineates the southern boundary with
      California and Nevada. The western boundary is formed by the Pacific
      Ocean. Oregon has been home to many indigenous nations for thousands of
      years. The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring
      what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early to mid-16th century. As
      early as 1564, the Spanish began sending vessels northeast from the
      Philippines, riding the Kuroshio Current in a sweeping circular route
      across the northern part of the Pacific. In 1592, Juan de Fuca undertook
      detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest,
      including the Oregon coast as well as the strait now bearing his name. The
      Lewis and Clark Expedition traversed Oregon in the early 1800s, and the
      first permanent European settlements in Oregon were established by fur
      trappers and traders. In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the
      Oregon Country, and the Oregon Territory was created in 1848. Oregon
      became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859.
