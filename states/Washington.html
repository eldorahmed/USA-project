    <h3>About Washington</h3>
    <p>
      Washington, officially the State of Washington,[3] is a state in the
      Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is often referred to as
      Washington state to distinguish it from the national capital,[4] both
      named for George Washington (the first U.S. president). Washington borders
      the Pacific Ocean to the west, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and
      the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. The state was
      formed from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded
      by the British Empire in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. It was admitted to the
      Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital, and the
      most populous city is Seattle. Washington is the 18th-largest state, with
      an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), and the 13th-most populous
      state, with more than 7.8 million people.[5] The majority of Washington's
      residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of
      transportation, business, and industry on Puget Sound,[6][7] an inlet of
      the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords and bays
      carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep
      temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, center,
      northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east,
      center, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the
      second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United
      States, after California. Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano, is the
      state's highest elevation at 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), and is the most
      topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S.
