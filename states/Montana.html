    <h3>About Montana</h3>
    <p>
      Montana (/mɒnˈtænə/ ⓘ) is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the
      Western United States. It borders Idaho to the west, North Dakota and
      South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and the Canadian provinces
      of Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan to the north. It is the
      fourth-largest state by area, the eighth-least populous state, and the
      third-least densely populated state. Its capital is Helena, while the most
      populous city is Billings. The western half of the state contains numerous
      mountain ranges, while the eastern half is characterized by western
      prairie terrain and badlands, with smaller mountain ranges found
      throughout the state. Most of Montana first came under American
      sovereignty with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and was explored by the
      Lewis and Clark Expedition shortly thereafter.[6] Fur trappers followed
      and were the main economic activity in the area until gold was discovered
      in 1852. The ensuing gold rush, along with the passage of the Homestead
      Acts in 1862, brought large numbers of American settlers to Montana.[6]
      Rapid population growth and development culminated in statehood on
      November 8, 1889. Mining, particularly around Butte and Helena, would
      remain the state's main economic engine through the mid-20th century.
