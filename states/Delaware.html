    <h3>About Delaware</h3>
    <p>
      Delaware (/ˈdɛləwɛər/ ⓘ DEL-ə-wair)[11] is a state in the Northeast and
      Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.[12] It borders Maryland to its
      south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast,
      and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state's name derives from the
      adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd
      Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia's first
      colonial-era governor.[13] <br /><br />
      Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and
      some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the 2nd
      smallest and 6th least populous state, but also the 6th most densely
      populated. Delaware's most populous city is Wilmington, and the state's
      capital is Dover, the 2nd most populous city in Delaware. The state is
      divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the
      50 U.S. states;[b] from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle
      County, Kent County, and Sussex County.
