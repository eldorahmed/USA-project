    <h3>About Massachusetts</h3>
    <p>
      Massachusetts (/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsɪts/ ⓘ MASS-ə-CHOO-sits, /-zɪts/ -⁠zits;
      Massachusett: Muhsachuweesut [məhswatʃəwiːsət]), officially the
      Commonwealth of Massachusetts,[b] is a state in the New England region of
      the Northeastern United States. It borders the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of
      Maine to its east, Connecticut and Rhode Island to its south, New
      Hampshire and Vermont to its north, and New York to its west.
      Massachusetts is the sixth-smallest state by land area. With over seven
      million residents as of 2020,[note 1] it is the most populous state in New
      England, the 16th-most-populous in the country, and the third-most densely
      populated, after New Jersey and Rhode Island. The state's capital and most
      populous city, as well as its cultural and financial center, is Boston.
      Other major cities are Worcester, Springfield and Cambridge. Massachusetts
      is also home to the urban core of Greater Boston, the largest metropolitan
      area in New England and a region profoundly influential upon American
      history, academia, and the research economy.[43] Originally dependent on
      agriculture, fishing, and trade,[44] Massachusetts was transformed into a
      manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution.[45] During the 20th
      century, the state's economy shifted from manufacturing to services;[46]
      and in the 21st century, Massachusetts has become the global leader in
      biotechnology,[47] and also excels in artificial intelligence,[48]
      engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.[49
