    <h3>About Illinois</h3>
    <p>
      Illinois (/ˌɪlɪˈnɔɪ/ ⓘ IL-in-OY) is a state in the Midwestern region of
      the United States. It borders Great Lakes to its northeast, the
      Mississippi River to its west, and the Wabash and Ohio rivers to its
      south.[b] Its largest metropolitan areas are Chicago and the Metro East
      region of Greater St. Louis. Other metropolitan areas include Peoria and
      Rockford, as well as Springfield, its capital, and Champaign-Urbana, home
      to the main campus of the state's flagship university. Of the fifty U.S.
      states, Illinois has the fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP), the
      sixth-largest population, and the 25th-largest land area. Illinois has a
      highly diverse economy, with the global city of Chicago in the northeast,
      major industrial and agricultural hubs in the north and center, and
      natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south. Owing
      to its central location and favorable geography, the state is a major
      transportation hub: the Port of Chicago has access to the Atlantic Ocean
      through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway and to the Gulf of
      Mexico from the Mississippi River via the Illinois Waterway. Chicago has
      been the nation's railroad hub since the 1860s,[6] and its O'Hare
      International Airport has been among the world's busiest airports for
      decades. Illinois has long been considered a microcosm of the United
      States and a bellwether in American culture, exemplified by the phrase
      Will it play in Peoria?.[7]
