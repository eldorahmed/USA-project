    <h3>About New Jersey</h3>
    <p>
      New Jersey is a state situated within both the Mid-Atlantic and
      Northeastern regions of the United States. It is the most densely
      populated of all 50 U.S. states, and is situated at the center of the
      Northeast megalopolis. New Jersey is bordered on its north and east by New
      York state; on its east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on
      its west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania; and on its southwest by
      Delaware Bay and Delaware. At 7,354 square miles (19,050 km2), New Jersey
      is the fifth-smallest state in land area, but with close to 9.3 million
      residents as of the 2020 United States census, its highest decennial count
      ever, it ranks 11th in population. The state capital is Trenton, and the
      state's most populous city is Newark. New Jersey is the only U.S. state in
      which every county is deemed urban by the U.S. Census Bureau with 13
      counties included in the New York metropolitan area, seven counties in the
      Philadelphia metropolitan area, and Warren County part of the heavily
      industrialized Lehigh Valley metropolitan area.
