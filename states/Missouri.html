    <h3>About Missouri</h3>
    <p>
      Missouri is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States.[6]
      Ranking 21st in land area, it borders Iowa to the north, Illinois,
      Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma,
      Kansas, and Nebraska to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested
      highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River,
      after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the
      Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. With over six
      million residents, it is the 19th-most populous state of the country. The
      largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia;
      the capital is Jefferson City. Humans have inhabited present-day Missouri
      for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at
      least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in
      the 14th century. When European explorers arrived in the 17th century,
      they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The French incorporated
      the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St.
      Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States
      acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans
      from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory. Missouri was
      admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Many
      from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of
      Mid-Missouri. Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri
      Rhineland.
