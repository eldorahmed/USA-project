    <h3>About Virginia</h3>
    <p>
      Virginia, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia,[a] is a state in the
      Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the
      Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains. The state's capital is
      Richmond and its most populous city is Virginia Beach, though its most
      populous subdivision is Fairfax County, part of Northern Virginia, where
      slightly over a third of Virginia's population of 8.72 million live as of
      2023. The Blue Ridge Mountains cross the western and southwestern parts of
      the state. The state's central region lies predominantly in the Piedmont.
      Eastern Virginia is part of the Atlantic Plain, and the Middle Peninsula
      forms the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The fertile Shenandoah Valley is
      home to the state's most productive agricultural counties, while the
      economy in Northern Virginia is driven by technology companies and U.S.
      federal government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense and
      Central Intelligence Agency. Hampton Roads is also the site of the
      region's main seaport and Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval
      base.
