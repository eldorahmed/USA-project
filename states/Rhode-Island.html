    <h3>About Rhode Island</h3>
    <p>
      Rhode Island (/ˌroʊd-/ ⓘ)[6][7] is a state in the New England region of
      the Northeastern United States. It borders Connecticut to its west;
      Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to its south
      via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a small maritime
      border with New York, east of Long Island.[8] Rhode Island is the smallest
      U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly fewer
      than 1.1 million residents as of 2020;[9] but it has grown at every
      decennial count since 1790 and is the second-most densely populated state,
      after New Jersey. The state takes its name from the eponymous island,
      though nearly all its land area is on the mainland. Providence is its
      capital and most populous city. Native Americans lived around Narragansett
      Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began arriving in the
      early 17th century.[10] Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British
      Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled
      religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven
      for religious liberty. He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased
      from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an
      explicitly secular government.[10] The Colony of Rhode Island and
      Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and
      political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker "Rogue's
      Island".[11]
