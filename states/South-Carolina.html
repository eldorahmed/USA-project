    <h3>About South Carolina</h3>
    <p>
      South Carolina (/ˌkærəˈlaɪnə/ ⓘ KARR-ə-LIE-nə) is a state in the coastal
      Southeastern region of the United States. It borders North Carolina to the
      north, the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and Georgia to the southwest
      across the Savannah River. Along with North Carolina, it makes up the
      Carolinas region of the East Coast. South Carolina is the 40th-largest and
      23rd-most populous U.S. state with a recorded population of 5,124,712
      according to the 2020 census.[4] In 2019, its GDP was $213.45 billion.
      South Carolina is composed of 46 counties. The capital is Columbia with a
      population of 137,300 in 2020;[5] while its largest city is Charleston
      with a 2020 population of 150,277.[6] The Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson,
      SC Combined Statistical Area is the most populous in the state, with a
      2020 population of 1,487,610.[7] South Carolina was named in honor of King
      Charles I of England, who first formed the English colony, with Carolus
      being Latin for "Charles".[8] In 1712 the Province of South Carolina was
      formed. One of the original Thirteen Colonies, South Carolina became a
      royal colony in 1719. During the American Revolutionary War, South
      Carolina was the site of major activity among the American colonies, with
      more than 200 battles and skirmishes fought within the state.[9] South
      Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution on May
      23, 1788. A slave state, it was the first state to vote in favor of
      secession from the Union on December 20, 1860. After the American Civil
      War, it was readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.
