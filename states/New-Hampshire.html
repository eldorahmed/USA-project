    <h3>About New Hampshire</h3>
    <p>
      New Hampshire (/ˈhæmpʃər/) is a state in the New England region of the
      Northeastern United States. It borders Massachusetts to the south, Vermont
      to the west, Maine and the Gulf of Maine to the east, and the Canadian
      province of Quebec to the north. Of the 50 U.S. states, New Hampshire is
      the fifth smallest by area and the tenth least populous, with a population
      of 1,377,529 residents as of the 2020 census. Concord is the state capital
      and Manchester is the most populous city. New Hampshire's motto, "Live
      Free or Die", reflects its role in the American Revolutionary War; its
      nickname, "The Granite State", refers to its extensive granite formations
      and quarries.[10] It is well known nationwide for holding the first
      primary (after the Iowa caucus) in the U.S. presidential election cycle,
      and for its resulting influence on American electoral politics.[11]
