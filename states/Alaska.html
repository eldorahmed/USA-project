    <h3>About Alaska</h3>
    <p>
      Alaska (/əˈlæskə/ ⓘ ə-LAS-kə) is a non-contiguous U.S. state on the
      northwest extremity of North America. It borders the Canadian province of
      British Columbia and the territory Yukon to the east; it shares a western
      maritime border in the Bering Strait with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous
      Okrug. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean lie to the north
      and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south. Technically a semi-exclave of the
      U.S., Alaska is the largest exclave in the world. <br /><br />

      Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than
      the next three largest states of Texas, California and Montana combined,
      and is the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. It is the
      third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, but is, with
      a population of 736,081 as of 2020, the continent's most populous
      territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with more than
      quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[6]
      The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United
      States by area. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S.
      city by area. The state's most populous city is Anchorage. Approximately
      half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.
