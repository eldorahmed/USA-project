    <h3>About Idaho</h3>
    <p>
      Idaho (/ˈaɪdəhoʊ/ ⓘ EYE-də-hoh) is a state in the Mountain West subregion
      of the United States. It shares a small portion of the Canada–United
      States border to the north, with the province of British Columbia. It
      borders Montana and Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and
      Washington and Oregon to the west. The state's capital and largest city is
      Boise. With an area of 83,570 square miles (216,400 km2), Idaho is the
      14th largest state by land area. With a population of approximately 1.8
      million, it ranks as the 13th least populous and the 6th least densely
      populated of the 50 U.S. states. <br /><br />
      For thousands of years, and prior to European colonization, Idaho has been
      inhabited by native peoples. In the early 19th century, Idaho was
      considered part of the Oregon Country, an area of dispute between the U.S.
      and the British Empire. It officially became a U.S. territory with the
      signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho Territory was
      not organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in Oregon
      Territory and Washington Territory. Idaho was eventually admitted to the
      Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state.
