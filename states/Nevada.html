    <h3>About Nevada</h3>
    <p>
      Nevada (/nɪˈvædə/ ⓘ niv-AD-ə,[4] Spanish: [neˈβaða]) is a state in the
      Western region of the United States.[c] It borders Oregon to the
      northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the
      southeast, and Utah to the east. Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the
      32nd-most populous, and the 9th-least densely populated of the U.S.
      states. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County,
      which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area,[5] including
      three of the state's four largest incorporated cities.[6] Nevada's capital
      is Carson City. Las Vegas is the largest city in the state. Nevada is
      officially known as the "Silver State" because of the importance of silver
      to its history and economy. It is also known as the "Battle Born State"
      because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words "Battle
      Born" also appear on its state flag); due to the presidency of Abraham
      Lincoln, the Union benefited immensely from the support of newly awarded
      statehood by the infusion of the monetary support of nearly $400 million
      in silver ore generated at the time by the Comstock Lode.
