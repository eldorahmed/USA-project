    <h3>About Texas</h3>
    <p>
      Texas (/ˈtɛksəs/ TEK-səs, locally also /ˈtɛksɪz/ TEK-siz;[8] Spanish:
      Texas or Tejas,[b] pronounced [ˈtexas]) is the most populous state in the
      South Central region of the United States. It borders Louisiana to the
      east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the
      west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and
      Tamaulipas to the south and southwest. Texas has a coastline with the Gulf
      of Mexico to the southeast. Covering 268,596 square miles (695,660 km2),
      and with over 30 million residents as of 2023,[10][11][12] it is the
      second-largest U.S. state by both area (after Alaska) and population
      (after California). The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and Greater Houston
      areas are the nation's fourth and fifth-most populous urban regions
      respectively. Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status
      as an independent republic, and as a reminder of the state's struggle for
      independence from Mexico. The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state
      flag and the Texas state seal.[13] Its capital city is Austin, the second
      most populous state capital in the U.S.
