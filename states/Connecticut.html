    <h3>About Connecticut</h3>
    <p>
      Connecticut (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ ⓘ kə-NET-ik-ət)[10] is the southernmost state in
      the New England region of the Northeastern United States. It borders Rhode
      Island to its east, Massachusetts to its north, New York to its west, and
      Long Island Sound to its south. Its capital is Hartford, and its most
      populous city is Bridgeport. Historically, the state is part of New
      England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey. The
      state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the
      state. The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings
      of Quinnetuket, a Mohegan-Pequot word for "long tidal river".[11] As of
      the 2020 United States census, Connecticut was home to over 3.6 million
      residents, its highest decennial count ever, growing every decade since
      1790. <br /><br />
      Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a
      small, short-lived settlement called House of Hope in Hartford at the
      confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was
      initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much
      of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the
      first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English.
