    <h3>About Kansas</h3>
    <p>
      Kansas (/ˈkænzəs/ ⓘ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United
      States.[10] Kansas is a landlocked state which borders Nebraska to the
      north; Missouri to the east; Oklahoma to the south; and Colorado to the
      west. Kansas is named after the Kansas River, in turn named after the
      Kansa people.[11][12][13][14] Its capital is Topeka, and its most populous
      city is Wichita, however the largest urban area is the bi-state Kansas
      City, MO–KS metropolitan area. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas
      was home to numerous and diverse Indigenous tribes. The first settlement
      of non-indigenous people in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth.
      The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political
      wars over the slavery debate. When it was officially opened to settlement
      by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, conflict
      between abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery
      settlers from neighboring Missouri broke out over the question of whether
      Kansas would become a free state or a slave state, in a period known as
      Bleeding Kansas.
