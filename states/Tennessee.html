    <h3>About Tennessee</h3>
    <p>
      Tennessee (/ˌtɛnɪˈsiː/ ⓘ TEN-iss-EE, locally /ˈtɛnɪsi/
      TEN-iss-ee),[8][9][10] officially the State of Tennessee, is a landlocked
      state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Kentucky
      to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east,
      Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest,
      and Missouri to the northwest. Tennessee is the 36th-largest by area and
      the 15th-most populous of the 50 states. Tennessee is geographically,
      culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East,
      Middle, and West Tennessee. Nashville is the state's capital and largest
      city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. Other major cities
      include Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville. Tennessee's
      population as of the 2020 United States census is approximately 6.9
      million.[11] Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772
      frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government
      west of the Appalachian Mountains.[12] Its name derives from Tanasi (ᏔᎾᏏ),
      a Cherokee town in the eastern part of the state that existed before the
      first European American settlement.[13] Tennessee was initially part of
      North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to
      the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. It earned the nickname "The
      Volunteer State" early in its history due to a strong tradition of
      military service.[14] A slave state until the American Civil War,
      Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts
      supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union
      sentiment. As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the
      first readmitted to the Union after the war.[15]
