    <h3>About Nebraska</h3>
    <p>
      Nebraska (/nəˈbræskə/ ⓘ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United
      States. It borders South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and
      Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River; Kansas to the
      south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. Nebraska is the
      16th largest state by land area, with just over 77,220 square miles
      (200,000 km2). With a population of over 1.9 million, it is the 37th most
      populous state and the 7th least densely populated. Its capital is
      Lincoln, and its most populous city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri
      River. Nebraska was admitted into the United States in 1867, two years
      after the end of the American Civil War. The Nebraska Legislature is
      unlike any other American legislature in that it is unicameral, and its
      members are elected without any official reference to political party
      affiliation.
