    <h3>About North Dakota</h3>
    <p>
      North Dakota ( /- dəˈkoʊtə/ ⓘ) is a U.S. state in the Upper Midwest, named
      after the indigenous Dakota Sioux. It is bordered by the Canadian
      provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the north and by the U.S. states
      of Minnesota to the east, South Dakota to the south, and Montana to the
      west. North Dakota is part of the Great Plains region, characterized by
      broad prairies, steppe, temperate savanna, badlands, and farmland. North
      Dakota is the 19th largest state, but with a population of less than
      780,000, it is the 4th least populous and 4th most sparsely
      populated.[note 1] The capital is Bismarck while the most populous city is
      Fargo, which accounts for nearly a fifth of the state's population; both
      cities are among the fastest-growing in the U.S., although half of all
      residents live in rural areas. What is now North Dakota was inhabited for
      thousands of years by various Native American tribes, including the
      Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara along the Missouri River; the Ojibwe and Cree
      in the northeast; and several Sioux groups (the Assiniboine, Yankton,
      Wahpeton, and Teton) across the rest of the state. European explorers and
      traders first arrived in the early 18th century, mostly in pursuit of
      lucrative furs.
