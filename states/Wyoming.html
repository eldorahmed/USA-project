    <h3>About Wyoming</h3>
    <p>
      Wyoming (/waɪˈoʊmɪŋ/ ⓘ) is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the
      Western United States. It borders Montana to the north and northwest,
      South Dakota and Nebraska to the east, Idaho to the west, Utah to the
      southwest, and Colorado to the south. With a population of 576,851 in
      2020,[8] Wyoming is the least populous state despite being the 10th
      largest by area, with the second-lowest population density after Alaska.
      The state capital and most populous city is Cheyenne, which had an
      estimated population of 63,957 in 2018.[9] Wyoming's western half consists
      mostly of the ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains; its eastern
      half consists of high-elevation prairie, and is referred to as the High
      Plains. Wyoming’s climate is semi-arid in some parts and continental in
      others, making it drier and windier overall than other states, with
      greater temperature extremes. The federal government owns just under half
      of Wyoming’s land, generally protecting it for public uses. The state
      ranks sixth in the amount of land—-and fifth in the proportion of its
      land—-that is owned by the federal government.[10] Its federal lands
      include two national parks (Grand Teton and Yellowstone), two national
      recreation areas, two national monuments, and several national forests, as
      well as historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.
