    <h3>About Arizona</h3>
    <p>
      Arizona (/ˌærɪˈzoʊnə/ ⓘ ARR-ih-ZOH-nə; Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo [hoː˥z̥to˩
      ha˩hoː˩tso˩];[10] O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak [ˈaɭi̥ ˈʂɔnak])[11] is a state in the
      Southwestern region of the United States. Arizona is part of the Four
      Corners region with Utah to the north, Colorado to the northeast, and New
      Mexico to the east; its other neighboring states are Nevada to the
      northwest, California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and
      Baja California to the south and southwest. It is the 6th-largest and the
      14th-most-populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is
      Phoenix. <br /><br />
      Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted
      to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Historically part
      of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of
      independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican–American
      War, Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848,
      where the area became part of the territory of New Mexico. The
      southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden
      Purchase.
