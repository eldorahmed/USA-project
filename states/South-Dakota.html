    <h3>About South Dakota</h3>
    <p>
      South Dakota (/- dəˈkoʊtə/ ⓘ; Sioux: Dakȟóta itókaga, pronounced [daˈkˣota
      iˈtokaga]) is a U.S. state in the North Central region of the United
      States. It is also part of the Great Plains. South Dakota is named after
      the Dakota Sioux tribe, which comprises a large portion of the population
      with nine reservations currently in the state and has historically
      dominated the territory.[8] South Dakota is the 17th largest by area, but
      the 5th least populous, and the 5th least densely populated of the 50
      United States. Pierre is the state capital, and Sioux Falls, with a
      population of about 213,900,[9] is South Dakota's most populous city.[10]
      The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South Dakota into
      two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as
      "East River" and "West River".[11] South Dakota is bordered by the states
      of North Dakota (to the north), Minnesota (to the east), Iowa (to the
      southeast), Nebraska (to the south), Wyoming (to the west), and Montana
      (to the northwest). Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia,
      with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late
      19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush
      in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east.
      Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending
      with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. As the southern part of the former
      Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889,
      simultaneously with North Dakota. They are the 39th and 40th states
      admitted to the union; President Benjamin Harrison shuffled the statehood
      papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state
      first.[12]
