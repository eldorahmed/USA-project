    <h3>About Colorado</h3>
    <p>
      Colorado (/ˌkɒləˈrædoʊ, -ˈrɑːdoʊ/ ⓘ,[8][9] other variants[10]) is a state
      in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. Colorado
      borders Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the
      east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, Utah to the
      west, and meets Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. Colorado is
      noted for its landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas,
      canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. Colorado is one of the
      Mountain States and is often considered to be part of the southwestern
      United States. The high plains of Colorado may be considered a part of the
      midwestern United States. It encompasses most of the Southern Rocky
      Mountains, as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and
      the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is the eighth most
      extensive and 21st most populous U.S. state. The United States Census
      Bureau estimated the population of Colorado at 5,877,610 as of July 1,
      2023, a 1.80% increase since the 2020 United States census.[11]
