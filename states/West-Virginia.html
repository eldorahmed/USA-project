    <h3>About West Virginia</h3>
    <p>
      West Virginia is a state in the Southern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the
      United States.[Note 2] It borders Pennsylvania to the north and east,
      Maryland to the east and northeast, Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to
      the southwest, and Ohio to the northwest. West Virginia is the
      10th-smallest state by area and ranks as the 12th-least populous state,
      with a population of 1,793,716 residents.[5] The capital and most populous
      city is Charleston with a population of 49,055. West Virginia was admitted
      to the Union on June 20, 1863, and was a key border state during the
      American Civil War. It was the only state to form by separating from a
      Confederate state, one of two states (along with Nevada) admitted to the
      Union during the Civil War, and the second state to separate from another
      state, after Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820. Some of its
      residents held slaves, but most were yeoman farmers, and the delegates
      provided for the gradual abolition of slavery in the new state
      constitution. The state legislature abolished slavery in the state, and at
      the same time ratified the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery nationally on
      February 3, 1865.
