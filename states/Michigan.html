    <h3>About Michigan</h3>
    <p>
      Michigan (/ˈmɪʃɪɡən/ ⓘ MISH-ig-ən) is a state in the Great Lakes region of
      the Upper Midwestern United States. It borders Wisconsin to the northwest
      in the Upper Peninsula, and Indiana and Ohio to the south in the Lower
      Peninsula; it is also connected by Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and
      Erie to Minnesota and Illinois, and the Canadian province of Ontario. With
      a population of nearly 10.12 million and an area of 96,716 sq mi (250,490
      km2), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest
      by area, and the largest by area east of the Mississippi River.[b] Its
      capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Metro Detroit is
      among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. The
      name derives from a gallicized variant of the original Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ
      (mishigami),[c] meaning "large water" or "large lake".[2][7]
