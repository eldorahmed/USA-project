    <h3>About Wisconsin</h3>
    <p>
      Wisconsin (/wɪˈskɒnsɪn/ ⓘ) is a state in the Upper Midwestern region of
      the United States. It borders Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the
      southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to
      the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the
      25th-largest state by land area and the 20th-most populous. The bulk of
      Wisconsin's population live in areas situated along the shores of Lake
      Michigan. The largest city, Milwaukee, anchors its largest metropolitan
      area, followed by Green Bay and Kenosha, the third- and
      fourth-most-populated Wisconsin cities, respectively. The state capital,
      Madison, is currently the second-most-populated and fastest-growing city
      in the state.[13] Wisconsin is divided into 72 counties and as of the 2020
      census had a population of nearly 5.9 million.
