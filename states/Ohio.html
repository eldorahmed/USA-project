    <h3>About Ohio</h3>
    <p>
      Ohio (/oʊˈhaɪoʊ/ ⓘ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United
      States. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east,
      West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the
      west, and Michigan to the northwest. Of the 50 U.S. states, it is the
      34th-largest by area. With a population of nearly 11.8 million, Ohio is
      the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated state. Its
      capital and largest city is Columbus, with other large population centers
      including Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, and Toledo. Ohio is
      nicknamed the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans
      are also known as "Buckeyes".[10] Its flag is the only non-rectangular
      flag of all U.S. states.
