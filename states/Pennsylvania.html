    <h3>About Pennsylvania</h3>
    <p>
      Pennsylvania (/ˌpɛnsɪlˈveɪniə/ ⓘ PEN-sil-VAY-nee-ə, lit. 'Penn's forest'),
      officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania[b] (Pennsylvania Dutch:
      Pennsylvanie),[7] is a state spanning the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern,
      Appalachian, and Great Lakes regions of the United States. Pennsylvania
      borders Delaware to its southeast, Maryland to its south, West Virginia to
      its southwest, Ohio to its west, Lake Erie and New York to its north, the
      Delaware River and New Jersey to its east, and the Canadian province of
      Ontario to its northwest. Pennsylvania is the fifth-most populous state in
      the United States, with over 13 million residents as of the 2020 United
      States census.[4] The state is the 33rd-largest by area and has the
      ninth-highest population density among all states. The largest
      metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is the southeastern Delaware Valley,
      which includes and surrounds Philadelphia, the state's largest and
      nation's sixth-most populous city. The second-largest metropolitan area,
      Greater Pittsburgh, is centered in and around Pittsburgh, the state's
      second-largest city. The state's subsequent five most populous cities are
      Allentown, Reading, Erie, Scranton, and Bethlehem.[8][9] The state capital
      is Harrisburg.
