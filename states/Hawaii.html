    <h3>About Hawaii</h3>
    <p>
      Hawaii (/həˈwaɪi/ ⓘ hə-WY-ee; Hawaiian: Hawaiʻi [həˈvɐjʔi, həˈwɐjʔi]) is
      an island state of the United States, in the Pacific Ocean about 2,000
      miles (3,200 km) southwest of the U.S. mainland. It is the only state not
      on the North American mainland, the only state that is an archipelago, and
      the only state in the tropics. <br /><br />
      Hawaii consists of 137 volcanic islands that comprise almost the entire
      Hawaiian archipelago (the exception, which is outside the state, is Midway
      Atoll). Spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km), the state is physiographically
      and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.[9]
      Hawaii's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth-longest in the U.S.,
      at about 750 miles (1,210 km).[d] The eight main islands, from northwest
      to southeast, are Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe,
      Maui, and Hawaiʻi, after which the state is named; the latter is often
      called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the
      state or archipelago. The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make
      up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the largest
      protected area in the U.S. and the fourth-largest in the world.
