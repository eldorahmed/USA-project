    <h3>About Indiana</h3>
    <p>
      Indiana (/ˌɪndiˈænə/ ⓘ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United
      States. It borders Lake Michigan to the northwest, Michigan to the north
      and northeast, Ohio to the east, the Ohio River and Kentucky to the south
      and southeast, and the Wabash River and Illinois to the west. It is the
      38th-largest by area and the 17th-most populous of the 50 States. Its
      capital and largest city is Indianapolis. Indiana was admitted to the
      United States as the 19th state on December 11, 1816. Various indigenous
      peoples inhabited what would become Indiana for thousands of years, some
      of whom the U.S. government expelled between 1800 and 1836. Indiana
      received its name because the state was largely possessed by native tribes
      even after it was granted statehood. Since then, settlement patterns in
      Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the
      Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily
      by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from
      the Mid-Atlantic states and adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by
      settlers from the Upland South, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee.[15]
