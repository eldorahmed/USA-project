    <h3>About Minnesota</h3>
    <p>
      Minnesota (/ˌmɪnəˈsoʊtə/ ⓘ MIN-ə-SOH-tə) is a state in the Upper
      Midwestern region of the United States. It is the 12th largest U.S. state
      in area and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.75 million residents.
      Minnesota is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" for having more than
      14,000 bodies of fresh water covering at least ten acres each;[7] roughly
      a third of the state is forested; much of the remainder is prairie and
      farmland. More than 60% of Minnesotans (about 3.7 million) live in the
      Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, known as the "Twin Cities", the
      state's main political, economic, and cultural hub[8] and the 16th-largest
      metropolitan area in the U.S. Other minor metropolitan and micropolitan
      statistical areas include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester, and St.
      Cloud.[9]
