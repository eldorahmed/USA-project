    <h3>About Maryland</h3>
    <p>
      Maryland (US: /ˈmɛrɪlənd/ ⓘ MERR-il-ənd)[b] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic
      region of the United States.[8][9] The state borders Virginia to its
      south, West Virginia to its west, Pennsylvania to its north, Delaware to
      its east, the Atlantic Ocean, and the national capital of Washington, D.C.
      With a total area of 12,407 square miles (32,130 km2), Maryland is the
      ninth-smallest state by land area,[10] and its population of 6,177,224
      ranks it the 18th-most populous state and the fifth-most densely
      populated. Maryland's most populous city is Baltimore, and the capital is
      Annapolis.[11] Occasional nicknames include Old Line State, the Free
      State, and the Chesapeake Bay State. It is named after Henrietta Maria,
      the French-born queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland during the 17th
      century.[12][13] The western portion of the state contains numerous
      stretches of the Appalachian Mountains, the central portion is primarily
      composed of the Piedmont, and the eastern side of the state makes up a
      significant portion of Chesapeake Bay.
